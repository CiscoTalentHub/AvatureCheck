AvatureCheck

A python program to check a list of new leads or candidates to see if they exist in Avature.

Currently the working version of AvatureCheck is in the main branch. I've added a second branch called AddConfing to add configuration file support and OS detection features.

Other features that I plan on adding are:
*UI both cli and gui, along with command line arguments
*Optional prechecking and storing of terms to reduce load on Avature severs
*Multi-value checking logic allowing to check for term A OR term b, or check for term A AND term B. Eventually allowing for combinations.
*Improved setup for testing. This is more of a personal thing as right now I'm just adding print statements and I'm looking for a better way.
*Setup program installer to allow it to install and run on machines where Python is not used often
